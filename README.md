<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  My name is Ryan Grimes, and I am a
graduating senior majoring in cybersecurity at
Hampton University with a strong interest in coding,
digital forensics, and risk management. My
academic journey has been shaped by hands-on
coursework, national competitions, and research
opportunities that have sharpened my technical
abilities and critical thinking skills. I’ve presented my
work at the Hampton University’s School of Science Symposium and participated in
competitions with ADMI, Leidos, and CollegeBoard, and I’m always looking for ways to
apply what I learn in meaningful, real-world contexts.
In my free time I enjoy spending time with family and friends, fishing, and playing
video games. My interest in computer science began with my interest in technology and
videogames combined with my natural curiosity and analytical skills. I began learning
Scratch and Java in my computer science class while also taking a forensic science
class my senior year of highschool. That’s when I knew computer science and digital
forensics was for me.
With a strong foundation in programming, a growing research portfolio, and a
commitment to public service, I’m eager to garner experience and connect with
professionals, researchers, and organizations who share similar goals in the
cybersecurity and tech communities.
