<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  My name is Ryan Grimes, and I am a
graduating senior majoring in cybersecurity at
Hampton University with a strong interest in coding,
digital forensics, and risk management. My
academic journey has been shaped by hands-on
coursework, national competitions, and research
opportunities that have sharpened my technical
abilities and critical thinking skills. Proficient in JavaScript and skilled in Unix, Python and SQL, my academic background and passion for cybersecurity position me as a
valuable candidate. Eager to apply my skills in a real-world setting, I bring a strong work ethic and effective problem-solving
abilities. I look forward to contributing to a dynamic team and discussing how my enthusiasm aligns with my team’s goals.
